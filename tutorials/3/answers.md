# Task 0
1. Minimal routing is the ideal routing for uniform random traffic. Why?

A: 

2. Non-minimal / Valiant routing is the ideal routing for adversarial traffic. Why?

A:

3. What is the ideal throughput for uniform random traffic and adversarial traffic?

A: 

4. In non-minimal routing, the intermediate node is chosen randomly. Why?

A: 

5. What is the adversarial traffic for a 1D Flattened Butterfly topology? Define as an equation as 
shown in Table 3.1 in Dally’s textbook. (Hint: an adversarial traffic is a traffic that causes the 
largest bottleneck, hence reducing the ideal throughput. Refer to Section 3.3 of Dally’s textbook).

A: 

# Task 1
1. Simulate a 16-router, 256-nodes 1D Flattened Butterfly node (please adjust the value of k, c, n, 
x, y, xr, and yr accordingly). Run minimal routing on adversarial traffic. What is the saturation 
throughput (Hint: plot the latency-throughput graph)? Is it far from the ideal throughput?

A: 

2. Similar with question 1, we will run minimal routing on adversarial traffic but on a 4-router, 16-
nodes 1D Flattened Butterfly. Is the saturation throughput higher/lower than the configuration 
in Question 1? Why?

A: 

3. Similar with question 1 and 2 but try with a 32-router, 1024-node 1D Flattened Butterfly. How 
does the saturation throughput compare (higher/lower) with question 1 and 2? Why? 

A:

# Task 2
1. How does UGAL work? How does it decide when to route minimally or non-minimally?

A: 

2. Run the simulation on a 16-router, 256-nodes 1D Flattened Butterfly. What is the saturation throughput achieved by UGAL for minimal and adversarial traffic? Does it approach the ideal saturation throughput for both traffics?

A: 

3. Do you think the performance of UGAL will be affected if it is run on different network sizes (16-nodes and 1024-nodes 1D Flattened Butterfly).
